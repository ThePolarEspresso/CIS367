# Project Description

For my term project, I created a scene in Blender that simulates the experience of being inside a moving train. The background seen from out 
the window is generated using a series of procedurally generated hills on plain objects, while the 3D train object was modeled from scratch. 
Additionally, The train object moves up and down using a noise modifier to further drive home the illusion of being inside a moving train.
